# Learn Hiragana game

- time how fast you type the answer
- as soon as you type correct answer, count it and move to next
- choice of how many you want to be quizzed on at beginning
- words we get wrong, or take too long on, get penalized, and added for "needs extra review"

- in the "database", we key by character, and then it has a list of attempts (with how long, and whether correct)
- should be a mechanism to "give up" -- i like the space bar showing you the answer -- and then you type it. sure.
